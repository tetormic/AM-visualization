# AM-visualization
This is an ipynb to visualize the amplitude modulated signal in the time and the frequency domain

Future versions should include...
1. ... interactive controls over Amplitudes and frequencies of the carrier and modulation signals.
2. ... resizable plots (though I don't know whether that is possible)
